## Minimal Cardboard Spool Adapter

This adapter inserts into certain cardboard spools to eliminate the cardboard dust from spinning against the spool holders.

Fits cardboard spools:
* Polymaker
* Overture
* Inland (Microcenter)
* Duramic

I personally use Polymaker filament because I like their cardboard spools.

The goal with this model was to make it re-usable. The added chamfers make it easier to insert and remove. I've removed extra connections used in other models such as inner tabs which I've read in reviews can snap off. The smaller dimensions make this faster to print. I like to use this as a first print for new filament as well to see what the final color looks like.

Outer Dimensions of the holder is 55mm.

Also included is the OpenSCAD file. It uses the BOSL2 library (https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2) for the chamfer_cylinder_mask module/function.

### Print settings

* No supports
* 3 perimeters recommended
* No Infill required if using 3 perimeters
* PLA or PETG work fine
* 0.3mm layer height in Draft mode

Default print settings also work fine.
